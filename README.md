WELCOME to COFFEEMUD

Small MUD (multi-user-dungeon) in Java, working via websockets and telnet, code and comments in english but ingame-language is german for now. 
Still lots of work and room for improvement but basic functionalities up and working. Started this as a project for a game-jam but missed the 
deadline, now handing it in for an university project.


TODO:
- add registration to save progress and characters
- add hp System, followed by possible fight and evolution
- improve input-handling, maybe moving away from regex all together
- seperate classes and content more for better universal use
- take a deeper look into dependency injection
- work on details and how to access them in a senseful way - atm a lot of workarounds to meet a deadline at university
